    <h2>What is React?What are its features</h2>
    <p>React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. 
        It’s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. 
        React first deployed on Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.
 Features of React Js:

            <ul type="circle">
            <li>React Js is Declarative</li>
            <li>React js. is Simple</li>
            <li>React js is component Based</li>
            <li>reacgt.js supports Server side</li>
            <li>React.js is Fast</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Explain Virtual Dom?</h2>
    <p>Virtual DOM is a representation of the DOM. The creation of real dom will be handled by browsers. 
        Modern frameworks like react, vue, etc.., will create a tree of elements similar to real dom in memory this is called virtual DOM.</p>
    <span>we will have it listed below with additional reasons why many frameworks adopt the use of virtual DOM.

        Boosts Performance.
        Very fast in DOM update.
        Allows you to write declarative contents.
        Simple and less complexity is involved.
        Light weighted.
        Helps keep your UI clean and updates on the required component in your application.
        Compile-time change optimization.
        Easy change detection

        <h3>What are the different phases of React component’s lifecycle?</h3>
<p> the React component’s lifecyle methods can be split in four phases: initialization, mounting, updating and unmounting.</p>
<span>The initialization phase is where we define defaults and initial values for this.props and this.state by implementing getDefaultProps() and getInitialState() respectively.</span>
<span>Mounting is the process that occurs when a component is being inserted into the DOM. This phase has two methods that we can hook up with: componentWillMount() and componentDidMount().</span>
<span>There are also methods that will allow us to execute code relative to when a component’s state or properties get updated</span>


<h3>What is the diff between class and functional components? why we are moving towards functional comp ?</h3>
<table border="1">
<th>
    <tr>
        <th>Class Compomonents</th>
        <th>Functional Components</th>
    </tr>
</th>
<tr>
    <td>recive Parameter(Props)-Optional</td>
    <td>has Local State</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Stateless or dumb components</td>
    <td>Recieve parameter (props) -Optional</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Just plain old Js functions</td>
    <td> Staetful or smarat components</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Shorter to write</td>
    <td>has lifecyle hooks </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>For UI Components</td>
    <td>can handle fetching data via ajax calls</td>
</tr>

</table>
functional components 
1. easy to understand
2.they aree easy to debug
3.ease to resuse.


<h3>Differentiate between stateful and stateless components.</h3>

            <td>Staetful Components</td>
            <td>Stateless Components</td>

            <td>
                Stores information about components state change in memory
            </td>
            <td>Calculates the internal state of Components</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Having authority to change</td>
            <td>don t have the authority to change state</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Contains the knowledge of past ,current,and poassible futures changes in state.</th>
            <th>Contains no knowledge of past current and possible future state changes.</th>
